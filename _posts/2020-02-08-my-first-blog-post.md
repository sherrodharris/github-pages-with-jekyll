I truly started on my journey as a programmer/data scientist today. I may have had several instances where I grabbed a small bit of knowledge to have but never a sustained information gathering stage. Today is that day. Today is the day where the roadmap has been built and it is time to follow the "yellow brick road." Just about five weeks before I turn 32 (the 10 year mark I told myself I would need to put it all together in my own way." It's just around the corner. I can not wait to look at what I have done, this St. Patrick's day.
